# More C# Syntax
    - static method
    - method overload
    - If the property is not required in the constructor, mark the property as a possible null value with "?"
   
# Test double (using )
    - Dummy
        - objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists.
    - Stub
        - provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it 'sent', or maybe only how many messages it 'sent'.
    - Mock
        - are what we are talking about here: objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.
    - Fake
        - replace a real but expensive thing for testing purposes, like using a fake database or something. Only used in integration testing.
