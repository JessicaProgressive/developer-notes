- More C# syntax
    - Strings are also reference type and they are immutable.
    - init keyword and required keyword
    ```csharp
    //Property Name needs to be initialized in the constructor
    public required string Name {set; init;};
    ```
    - List and IEnumerable
        - IEnumerable is a deferred execution while List is an immediate execution while using Linq
    - Record and Class
    - delegate is (basically) a class that creates instances of a method and execute it
    - extension method
