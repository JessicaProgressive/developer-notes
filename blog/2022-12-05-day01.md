- A littile about Dotnet.
    - Dotnet Core is the spin-off from Dotnet Framework that works as cross platform.
    Even number releases are long-term supported and odd number releases are shoet-term supported.
    - Common Language Runtime (CLR) executes programs written in any of several supported languages, allowing them to share common object-oriented classes written in any of the languages.
    - Intermediate Language (IL). It is the code compiled from the source code.
    - Program.cs is the entry point for a .net application.       

- Basic changes made to convert a console app into a web app.
    ```csharp
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
    ```
    ```csharp
    "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:1337"
    ```

- How to build a basic endpoint for API
```csharp
app.MapGet("/break/{minutes:int}", (int minutes, DateUtils helper) =>
{
    var res = new BreakTimerResponse(
        minutes,
        DateTime.Now,
        helper.TakeABreak(minutes)
        );

    return Results.Ok(res);
});
```

- Example for adding service before building the web app.
```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<DateUtils>();
```
