- Some C# Syntax
    - Data Types
        ```csharp
        char / string 
        short / int / long 
        decimal / double
        var (need to be initialized)
        ```
    - Special character escape
        ```csharp
        string sentence = @"c:\dev\developerNote";
        ```
    - Format integer to currency
        ```csharp
        integer.ToString("c");
        ```

- Some useful shortcuts (that I can remember)
    - ```ctrl + .```  turn on lightbulb/suggestions
    - ```ctrl + .```  Magic 
    - ```ctrl + R, A```   run all tests
    - ```ctrl + R, T```   run a single test
    - ```ctrl + R, R```  change all occurrances of a variable
    - ```alt + F12```   peek implementation

- Memory Management
    - Stack
        - Value type (defined by a struct) is stored on the stack
        - Value types stored on the stack get destroyed once it's out of local scope
    - Heap
        - Reference type (defined by a class) is stored on the heap, and the variables from the stack hold the reference number of the location on the heap.
        - When stack is cleared out, the reference on the heap continues to live until it gets garbage collected.
    - Garbage Collector

- Unit Tests (Xunit)
    - Attributes
        ```csharp
        [Fact]
        public void Test()
        {
            //Arrage
            int a = 10, b = 5, actual;
            //Act
            actual = a + b;
            //Assert
            Assert.Equal(15, actual);    
        }
        ```
        ```csharp
        [Theory]
        [InlineData("J", false)]
        [InlineData("Jess", false)]
        [InlineData("Jessica", true)] 
        public void Test2(string str, bool expected)
        {
            bool actual = str == "Jessica";
            Assert.Equal(expected, actual);
        }
        ```
        
- TDD (Test Driven Development)
    - AAA (Arrange/Act/Assert). Writing tests that intentiously fail first and then refactor code to make it pass. Keep refactoring (till it passes the code review I guess).
    ```csharp
    [Theory]
    [InlineData(200, 4800)]
    public void MakingWithrawalsDecreasesBalance(decimal amountToWithdraw, decimal expected)
    {
        // Arrange
        var account = new BankAccount();
        var openingBalance = account.GetBalance();
        // Act
        account.Withdraw(amountToWithdraw);
        decimal actualBalance = openingBalance - amountToWithdraw;
        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(expected, actualBalance);
    }
    ```
